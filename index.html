          <h5>Global Game Jam 2022</h5>
          <p>Escape the darkness is a first person horror/thriller game involving a person trying to defeat a monster while trapped in a laminal space with eerie realities. The game follows the main theme of duality in that it is a symbolization of the Abject, a feeling incurred by treading on a plane between two conceptual borders. For this reason the game occurs in an abandoned hospital maze with repetitive rooms/paths that are never quite the same and involve a character who caries a flashlight in a well lit room while chanting Latin prayers to electric switches.</p>
